Definitely not a Twitter clone.
This is an assignment for my Front End class at The Iron Yard.
This was to practice writing asynchronous tests and ones that require a specific piece of HTML to execute.
Added a build process.
In order to create a new build:
1. Run npm install --save-dev grunt in your terminal
2. Create a gruntfile.js in your root directory
3. Run npm install grunt-contrib-copy --save-dev
4. In gruntfile, write your first task (which should be copy)
5. Ensure you can run grunt build from the command line after doing so
6. Install the rest of your dependencies and their correlating tasks
7. Throughout the process, continuously run grunt built to ensure your tasks run to completion
Included folder for sass and js.
